								<h2>Fighting air pollution</h2>
								<p>One of the largest problems that thriving societies are facing is the damage that they are creating to the global environment by using factories and vehicles that poisons the air we all breath on a daily basis. Combustion cars are constantly polluting the air making life harder for those that live with a permanent stream of toxic air. The result of a lifetime of poisonous air consumption are clear: asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, cardiovascular problems and a threat to pregnant and newborns.</p>
								<p>Air pollution causes a reduction of a 70% of visible distance which is dangerous for those that use vehicles on a regular basis. Consequently, all cars have to use filters to protect motors and passengers from toxic air particles. If we don't actively work on this problem right now, future generations will suffer from genetic diseases such as diabetes and a decline in human intelligence on a massive global scale.</p>
								<h2>Helping the world with trees</h2>
								<p>Plants as we all know it, are the main natural filters that have been converting generating breathable air for mammals for hundreds of millions of years. They are great at what they do with minimal maintainance. That's why we chose to plant as many trees as possible as our mission for cleaning the air in a global attempt to reduce air pollution to sustainable levels. Technology will continue producing more environmentally harmful devices since it's a normal step in human evolution, therefore we'll balance that effect with more and more green sources of pure air.</p>
								<p>
									Help us in our mission to solve one of the biggest problems in humanity by contributing to the project and buying virtual crypto trees so that we expand our portfolio of green sources of clean air. Each tree that you buy and maintain with your funds will grow and prosper for many years to come. It only takes one initial step for the greater change. You are a major part of the evolution so go ahead and take a look at our dApp so that you can get a sense of what's possible!
