											<h2>More than a blockchain game</h2>
										</header>
										<p>When you buy a virtual tree, we plant a physical tree in the location of your choice from the available pool. Each tree generates AIR tokens which represent how much you're helping the environment with clean air. You can see the impact you're making to the world with a real-time dashboard that gets data straight from your trees using IOT devices powered by arduino.
										<br/><br/>
										Trees capture carbon dioxide to generate breathable oxygen that cleans the polluted air. They also convert bad smells into neutral or pleasant fragances naturally generated which massively improves the quality of life of people in big cities while saving the world.</p>

									<h2>Our Process</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img class="svg-image" src="images/hills.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>1. Buy a collectible tree</h3>
										<p>We created a live decentralized game that allow people from all over the globe to create their own forest in which they can purchase trees and see their growth as time goes by using real-time data straight from your trees.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img class="svg-image" src="images/trees.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>2. We plant a physical tree</h3>
										<p>Each tree you purchase, is a new tree that's maintained by our team members so that it flourishes beautifully. You have a wide variety of trees to choose from and you don't have to worry about maintainance, it's all on us. A small monthly fee will be required to keep the trees in perfect condition as management expenses.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img class="svg-image" src="images/windmills.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>3. Trees generate AIR tokens daily</h3>
										<p>Weekly, as your tree generates clean oxygen, you get rewarded AIR tokens that can be used for a variety of purposes. The more trees you have and the older they are, the more AIR you generate. AIR tokens are representative of how much oxygen has been generated from reducing carbon dioxide.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img class="svg-image" src="images/home.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>4. Spend AIR tokens for rewards</h3>
										<p>Once you have enough AIR, you can head out to our shop which provides you with discounts, coupons and all sorts of tradable objects that you can use immediately. You can also sell your AIR for fiat or crypto if you wish so at any point. Alternatively, you can use your AIR for management costs related to keeping your trees in perfect condition.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img class="svg-image" src="images/island.png" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>5. Trade trees with other members</h3>
										<p>If you get tired or want to change your tree portfolio, you can sell and buy trees from other members without any additional fees so that you have a wider variety of plants.</p>

									<h2>Here's why you should care</h2>
									<p>Earth is changing in many ways because of human pollution, there are only a few reasons why we must do something before our successors suffer the consecuences extracted from the non-profit Pure Earth.</p>
								</header>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon fa-diamond"></span>
										<strong>6.5 million people</strong> die each year because of diseases related to air pollution.
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-code-fork"></span>
										<strong>Up to 40 IQ points</strong> are lost by children that live in the most polluted areas.
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon fa-folder-open-o"></span>
										<strong><a href="https://www.who.int/phe/publications/air-pollution-global-assessment/en/" title="According to the World Health Organization">92% of the population</a></strong> lives in places where air pollution exceeds safe limits.
									</li>
									<li class="style4">
										<span class="icon fa-signal"></span>
										<strong>China</strong> is the most polluting country in the planet where a third of all global air contamination related deaths take place.
									</li>
									<li class="style5">
										<span class="icon fa-laptop"></span>
										<strong>64% of lakes</strong> are not clean enough for fishing and swimming because of bacteria, mercury, phosphorus and nitrogen produced by contamination.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="content">We are working on improving the efforts taken to fight air contamination with a simple action: planting trees. Trees are the lungs of the planet and they are our most efficient tools for reducing air and smell pollution. Help us today develop an efficient system in which you can contribute to create new forests all over the globe as massive sources of clean air that helps everyone around you.</p>
